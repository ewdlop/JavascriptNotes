To package a Node.js application into a standalone executable for Windows, you can use tools like **pkg** or **nexe**. These utilities bundle your application along with the Node.js runtime, allowing it to run independently of a Node.js installation on the target system.

**Using `pkg`**

`pkg` is a popular tool that compiles Node.js projects into executables for various platforms, including Windows.

1. **Install `pkg` globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g pkg
   ```

2. **Prepare your application:**

   Ensure your application's entry point (e.g., `index.js`) is correctly specified. If your project has a `package.json` file, verify that the `"main"` field points to this entry file.

3. **Build the executable:**

   Run the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   pkg .
   ```

   By default, `pkg` generates executables for multiple platforms. To create a Windows-specific executable, use the `--targets` option:

   ```bash
   pkg --targets node14-win-x64 .
   ```

   This command produces a Windows executable compatible with Node.js version 14 on a 64-bit system.

**Using `nexe`**

`nexe` is another tool that compiles Node.js applications into single executables.

1. **Install `nexe` globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g nexe
   ```

2. **Build the executable:**

   Navigate to your project's root directory and execute:

   ```bash
   nexe index.js
   ```

   Replace `index.js` with your application's entry point.

**Considerations**

- **Native Modules:** If your application depends on native modules, ensure they are compatible with the target platform and architecture.

- **File System Access:** When packaging, be mindful of how your application accesses files. Tools like `pkg` bundle files into a virtual file system, which may affect file path resolutions.

- **Testing:** After building the executable, test it on a clean Windows environment to confirm it runs as expected without requiring a Node.js installation.
